        <li>
          Indemnification
          <p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold Honely, our affiliates, and our and their respective shareholders, members, officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (collectively, <span class="static-underline">&ldquo;Honely Indemnitees&rdquo;</span>) harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees incurred by any Honely Indemnitee in connection with a third-party claim, action, or proceeding (each, a <span class="static-underline">&ldquo;Claim&rdquo;</span>) arising from your violation of these Terms or your negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Compliance &amp; Applicable Laws:
          <p>The Site is based in, and our services are only available in, the United States. The Site is designed to be accessed and used from the United States.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Termination:
          <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate these Terms and your access to all or any part of the Site, at any time and for any reason without prior notice or liability. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any part of the Site at any time without prior notice or liability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Binding Arbitration:
          <p>In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to these Terms or the Site (each, a <span class="static-underline">"Dispute"</span>), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (<span class="static-underline">"FAA"</span>). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CALIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT'S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS' rules and procedures are available at the JAMS Site <span class="static-underline">www.jamsadr.com</span>. Each party will be responsible for paying any JASM filling, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. As set forth in <span class="static-underline">Section 20</span> below, nothing in these Terms will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.</p>
          <p>In the event the laws of your state prohibit arbitration, this Section will not apply; however, all other provisions of the Terms will remain in effect.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Class Action Waiver:
          <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. In the event the laws of your state prohibit this class action waiver, this Section will not apply; however, all other provisions of the Terms will remain in effect.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Equitable Relief:
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce these Terms. We may, without waiving any other remedies under these Terms, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of Delaware for purposes of any such action by us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Controlling Law; Exclusive Forum:
          <p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the state of Florida. The exclusive jurisdiction for any claim, action or dispute with Honely or relating in any way to your use of the Site will be in the Florida twenty circuit court (Florida) and federal courts of the state of Florida and the venue for the adjudication or disposition of any such claim, action or dispute will be in Florida.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Miscellaneous:
          <p><span class="static-underline">Survival of Provisions.</span> If these Terms are terminated in accordance with the termination provision in Section 19 above, such termination shall not affect the validity of the following provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect indefinitely: "Intellectual Property," "Confidentiality," "Disclaimer of Warranties;" "Limitation of Liability," "Fair Housing Act Disclosure;" "Indemnification," "Compliance with Applicable Laws," "Binding Arbitration," "Class Action Waiver," "Equitable Relief," "Controlling Law;" "Exclusive Forum," and "Miscellaneous." </p>
          <p><span class="static-underline">No Waiver. </span>Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in these Terms. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The PVFT Licensing Agreement if any, is not superseded by these Terms.</p>
          <p><span class="static-underline">Scope of the Terms of Use. </span>These Terms will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.</p>
