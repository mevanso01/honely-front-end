Should the Parties fail to resolve any such disagreement within ten (10) business days, the Parties may agree to continue their negotiations.</p>
            <p>Unless the parties can settle their differences through negotiation or further attempts at negotiation appear futile, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, or any other dispute, controversy or claim between either of the parties hereto shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;<span class="static-underline">FAA</span>&rdquo;). NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  All disputes will be resolved before one (1) neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS&rsquo; Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS&rsquo; rules and procedures are available at the JAMS Site <span class="static-underline">www.jamsadr.com</span>. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator&rsquo;s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration proceeding shall take place in Boca Raton, Florida. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.</p>
            <p>We may also seek the appointment of an Emergency Arbitrator through JAMS to address and decide a request for injunctive relief in emergent circumstances, including but not limited to the unauthorized dissemination of or infringement of or unauthorized use of Our intellectual property.  Nothing in the preceding sentence and nothing in this Section shall bar Us from instead seeking injunctive relief in emergent circumstances including but not limited to the unauthorized dissemination of or infringement of intellectual property from a Florida court of law pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.</p>
