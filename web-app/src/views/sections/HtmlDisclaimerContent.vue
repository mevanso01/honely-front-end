          Hypothetical or simulated performance is not indicative of future results. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, all profit examples provided in our websites and publications are based on hypothetical or simulated trading, which means they are completed on paper or electronically based on real market prices at the period the recommendation is disseminated to the user of this service, but without actual money being invested. Also, such examples do not include the costs of subscriptions, commissions, and additional fees, or examples of additional recommendations as to which there were losses using the timing at the period of the recommendations.
